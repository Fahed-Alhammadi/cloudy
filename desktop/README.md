# Cloudy desktop

Sync client for macOS, Windows and Linux (Electron + TypeScript). It keeps one folder on the computer in two-way sync
with the user's Cloudy files. It is a menu bar / system tray app with a small settings window. Files only: no calendar
or contacts.

## How sync works

`src/main/sync.ts` (no Electron imports) compares three trees by relative path on each pass:

- the **local folder**;
- the **server**, read through `GET /api/nodes/:id`. Each folder's listing is cached and only re-read when its etag
  changes, and etags change all the way up the tree on every edit;
- **base**, which is both sides as of the last sync, saved in `sync-state.json` in the app's data folder.

Each side "changed" if it differs from base. Here is what each case does:

| Case | Result |
|---|---|
| One side changed | The change is copied to the other side. Uploads are chunked; downloads go to a temp file first. |
| Both sides changed | `name (conflicted copy <date>).ext` is kept next to the server version. |
| Same size, no history | The bytes are compared first, so a first sync into a folder that already has the files doesn't duplicate them. |
| Renamed or moved | Detected by inode (local) or node id (server) and repeated on the other side, not transferred again. |
| Deleted | Goes to the server trash or the computer's trash. |
| ≥ 100 files and ≥ half the folder deleted at once | The app asks first. "Keep" copies the files back. |

A pass is triggered by:

- the folder watcher (`fs.watch`, recursive);
- the server's live events (`/api/events`, SSE);
- a check every 5 minutes;
- waking from sleep.

Ignored names: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`, Office lock files, `.cloudy-tmp-*`. On Windows, names the
filesystem can't hold, and names that differ only by upper/lower case on macOS and Windows, are listed under
"Not synced".

Sign-in uses `POST /api/auth/token` (an app password named "Desktop (<hostname>)"). The token is encrypted with
`safeStorage` (the OS keychain).

## Layout

```
src/main/main.ts      tray, window, IPC handlers, login item
src/main/sync.ts      sync engine
src/main/api.ts       Cloudy API client (chunked upload, download, SSE)
src/main/store.ts     settings.json / sync-state.json (userData), token encryption
src/main/updater.ts   updates from the newest desktop-v* GitHub release (electron-updater, generic feed)
src/main/i18n.ts      t() + LANGUAGES; translations in i18n/<lang>.json (English keys, as on the web)
src/preload/          contextBridge: cloudy.call(name, ...args), cloudy.onUpdate(fn)
src/ui/               settings window (plain HTML/JS/CSS, no framework)
assets/               app icon (icon.png 1024 px), tray icons (trayTemplate = macOS menu bar)
test/sync.test.ts     sync tests: two engines against a real server
```

## Develop

```sh
cd desktop && npm install
npm start                                   # build + run (from VS Code's terminal: env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE npm start)
CLOUDY_USER_DATA=/tmp/cloudy-dev npm start  # separate settings/profile for development runs
npm run typecheck
CLOUDY_TEST_URL=http://localhost:8080 CLOUDY_TEST_USER=admin CLOUDY_TEST_PASSWORD=… npm test
npm run dist:mac | dist:win | dist:linux    # packages in dist/ (unsigned locally: CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false)
```

New texts: wrap them in `t('…')` and add them to all four `i18n/*.json` files (`python3 tests/i18n_check.py`).

## Updates

New versions are published as GitHub releases tagged `desktop-vX.Y.Z`, with all packages and the `latest*.yml`
update files. The installed app looks for the newest `desktop-v` release, because this repository also has server,
Android and iOS releases. It updates itself on macOS (from the `.zip`), on Windows, from an AppImage and from a
`.deb`. The macOS packages are signed with a Developer ID and notarized; the Windows installer is not signed yet.
