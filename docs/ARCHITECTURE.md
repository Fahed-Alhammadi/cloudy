# Cloudy architecture

Cloudy is a self-hosted cloud for files, sharing, calendars and contacts. It has these parts:
- one container running the Node.js server and its own PostgreSQL database;
- a browser app written in plain HTML5, served by the server;
- native apps for Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose) and iPhone (Swift, SwiftUI);
- a desktop sync app for macOS, Windows and Linux (Electron, TypeScript).

This document explains how the pieces fit together and why they are built the way they are.

## 1. Components

```
                 ┌───────────────── Cloudy server (Node 24, TypeScript) ─────────────────┐
browser ───────▶ │  /            static HTML5 app (public/)                                   │
Android, iPhone, │  /api/*       JSON API (session cookie or device token)                    │
desktop apps ──▶ │  /api/events  live updates (Server-Sent Events)                            │
                 │  /api/public  public share links (token + optional password)               │
WebDAV / CalDAV  │                                                                            │
/ CardDAV apps ─▶│  /dav/*       WebDAV files, CalDAV calendars, CardDAV address books         │
                 └─────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                               │                                  │
                         PostgreSQL 17                       /data volume
                   (metadata, shares, users,          blobs/  file contents (immutable)
                    calendars, contacts)              uploads/ resumable uploads in progress
```

**Container layout.**
- `tini` runs as process 1 and starts `cloudy-entrypoint`.
- The entrypoint, still as root, does the setup:
  - creates a named user for `APP_USER` (uid:gid);
  - fixes ownership of the database folder;
  - runs `initdb` the first time.
- It then drops to `APP_USER` and starts PostgreSQL 17, which listens only on the Unix socket
  `/run/cloudy`, with trust authentication and no TCP port.
- Once the database answers, it starts the Node server.
- If either process exits, the other is stopped and the container exits, so Docker's restart policy restarts
  both together.
- `docker stop` shuts both down cleanly.
- Setting `DATABASE_URL` skips the embedded database entirely.

TLS is provided by your own reverse proxy in front of the app port (see README). The server runs TypeScript
directly through Node's type stripping, so there is no build step. The web app is plain ES modules served as
static files.

## 2. The file model

```
nodes (PostgreSQL)                      DATA_DIR/blobs/ab/ab12…uuid
┌──────────────────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────────────┐
│ id, owner, parent_id, name   │  blob  │  file bytes, written     │
│ is_dir, size, mime, etag     │ ─────▶ │  once, never modified    │
│ mtime, deleted_at, …         │        └──────────────────────────┘
└──────────────────────────────┘
versions(node_id, blob, size, mtime)   ← the previous blob on each overwrite
```

- **The folder tree lives only in the database.** Rename and move change one row and never touch the disk.
- **File contents are immutable blobs.** Saving a file writes a new blob, and the old one becomes a version at
  no copying cost. Each file keeps `MAX_VERSIONS` versions.
- **Size and etag propagate up the tree.** Every change updates the size and etag of all parent folders, inside
  the same transaction. Clients detect changes by comparing one folder's etag.
- **Trash** marks a whole subtree with one `deleted_at` timestamp and remembers the original path. Restore brings
  back exactly that subtree. Items trashed earlier inside it stay in the trash. Trash is emptied after
  `TRASH_RETENTION_DAYS`.
- **Quota** counts live files, trash and versions.
- **Uploads** are resumable. The client opens an upload session, sends 8 MB chunks with an `Upload-Offset`
  header, and resumes from the server's offset after a network error.

## 3. Sharing and permissions

One `shares` table holds three kinds of share:
- **user** and **group** shares, each either read-only or editable;
- **public links**, with an optional password, expiry date and "allow upload".

Access rules:
- A user can **read** a node if they own it, or if it or one of its parent folders is shared with them or their
  group.
- **Changing or deleting** a node requires edit rights on its parent folder.
- A link only ever reaches the shared subtree. This is checked through the folder chain on every request.
- A link password unlocks a signed cookie (HMAC with a server secret).
- Nodes a user can't see return 404, not 403, so names of other people's files never leak.

## 4. Protocols

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/dav/files/<user>/…` | WebDAV: PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, GET, PUT, MKCOL, DELETE, MOVE, COPY, LOCK/UNLOCK. Locks are accepted but not enforced, which macOS Finder and Windows need to mount read-write. |
| `/dav/calendars/<user>/…` | CalDAV: MKCALENDAR, calendar-query (time ranges), calendar-multiget, sync-collection |
| `/dav/addressbooks/<user>/…` | CardDAV: extended MKCOL, addressbook-query, addressbook-multiget, sync-collection |
| `/.well-known/caldav`, `/.well-known/carddav` | Auto-discovery redirects |

Calendars and contacts are stored as raw iCalendar/vCard text and parsed with `ical.js`. The browser and the
phone apps use a JSON API that converts to and from these formats, and expands repeating events.

Change tracking for sync: a change log (`dav_changes`) plus a counter per collection lets clients fetch only
what changed since their last sync.

## 5. Authentication

| Client | How it signs in |
|---|---|
| Browser | Password or passkey → session cookie (HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Secure behind HTTPS) |
| Android, iPhone and desktop apps | `POST /api/auth/token` → device token, sent as `Authorization: Bearer …` (kept in app-private storage, the iOS Keychain, or encrypted with the OS keychain on desktop) |
| WebDAV / CalDAV / CardDAV apps | HTTP Basic with the account password or an app password |

- **Two-factor authentication** uses TOTP (RFC 6238: SHA-1, 6 digits, 30 s, ±1 step), implemented in `totp.ts`.
  - Setup keeps the secret pending until a valid code confirms it. Then 10 single-use recovery codes are issued,
    stored as SHA-256 hashes.
  - At login, a missing code returns `401 {twoFactor: true}`, so clients show the code field.
  - The last used time step is stored, so a code can't be replayed.
  - With 2FA on, HTTP Basic accepts only app passwords, never the account password.
- **Passkeys** (WebAuthn) are implemented in `webauthn.ts` with `node:crypto` only (minimal CBOR/COSE; ES256, EdDSA,
  RS256). Attestation is `none`, so the authenticator model is not verified.
  - Discoverable credentials with user verification required, so sign-in needs no username and skips TOTP.
  - RP ID = hostname of `PUBLIC_URL`, else of `Host` (`X-Forwarded-Host` with `TRUST_PROXY`); client origin must match.
  - Challenges are single-use, in memory, 5 minutes. A signature counter that fails to increase is rejected.
  - Registering one needs the account password; `user.id` is an HMAC of the username, not the username.
- Device tokens are app passwords. Users see them, and can revoke them, under *Settings → App passwords*.
- Passwords are hashed with scrypt. Tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes.
- Failed sign-ins are rate-limited per client IP. Behind a proxy, `TRUST_PROXY=true` makes the real client IP
  visible: Cloudy takes the right-most public address in `X-Forwarded-For` (proxies on local addresses are skipped,
  so Traefik → nginx → Cloudy works; addresses a client forges itself sit further left and are ignored).
- Every state-changing `/api` call must carry the `X-Cloudy-Request: 1` header. A cross-site form can't send it, so
  this blocks CSRF.

## 6. Updates

Each product (server, Android, iPhone, desktop) has its own version and is released on its own, tagged
`server-v…`, `android-v…`, `ios-v…` or `desktop-v…`.

- **Server:** `ghcr.io/fahed-alhammadi/cloudy:X.Y.Z` and `:latest`. `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
  updates it. `/status` reports the running version. The database and `/data` live in volumes, and the schema is
  applied idempotently at every start.
- **Android and iPhone:** updated by Google Play and the App Store (TestFlight during the beta). The apps have no
  updater of their own.
- **Desktop:** each version is a GitHub release with every package and electron-updater's `latest*.yml` files. The
  app asks the GitHub API for the newest `desktop-v*` release (the repository has other products' releases too),
  points electron-updater at that release, downloads in the background (SHA-512 checked) and installs on restart or
  quit. macOS builds are signed with a Developer ID and notarized.

## 7. Security notes

- Downloads: only images (except SVG), audio, video, PDF and text are ever served inline. Text is always sent as
  `text/plain`, with `nosniff` and a sandbox CSP. Uploaded HTML or SVG can't run on the app's origin.
- The web app runs under a strict Content Security Policy (`default-src 'self'`, no inline scripts).

## 8. Known limits

- Folder ZIP downloads have no ZIP64 support, so they must stay under 4 GB and 65,535 entries.
- Repeating events are edited as a whole series.
- No server-side encryption, external storage, full-text search, or calendar sharing yet. Passkeys are web-only.
- The desktop app syncs the user's own files (not "shared with me") and downloads every selected file; there are no
  online-only placeholders (macOS File Provider / Windows Cloud Files) yet.

## 9. Live updates

Triggers on `nodes` and `shares` (`schema.sql`) call `pg_notify('cloudy_changes', …)`; Postgres delivers
notifications only after commit and merges identical ones in a transaction, so trashing a big folder sends
one per affected folder. `events.ts` keeps one `LISTEN` connection (reconnects), batches for 250 ms, works out
who can see each changed folder (owner + user/group shares on it or an ancestor) and pushes
`event: change` / `{folders, shares}` over Server-Sent Events at `GET /api/events` (pings every 25 s,
`X-Accel-Buffering: no`). Because the triggers sit in the database, every path — JSON API, WebDAV, background
jobs, office saves — is covered. Clients reload the view only when it shows a changed folder, and the web app
waits while a dialog, menu or selection is open. The phone apps collect the stream while they're in the
foreground; the desktop app keeps it open and starts a sync pass on every event.

## 10. Office previews (LibreOffice)

The image includes LibreOffice without GUI (`libreoffice-*-nogui`). `GET /api/nodes/:id/preview` (read access)
converts an office file to PDF with `soffice --headless --convert-to pdf` and streams it; browsers show it in their
PDF viewer, Android renders it with `PdfRenderer`. `GET /api/office` lists the previewable extensions.
- Results are cached as `DATA_DIR/cache/previews/<id>-<etag>.pdf`: a changed file gets a new etag and is converted
  again, older PDFs of that file are deleted, and an hourly job removes previews unused for 30 days.
- One conversion runs at a time (queue), identical requests share it, 120 s timeout, 100 MB size limit. The blob is
  symlinked with its real extension so LibreOffice picks the right import filter; the LibreOffice profile lives in
  `/tmp` (not on a possibly-NFS `DATA_DIR`).
- Previews are read-only. Editing is limited to text files (web viewer and Android), saved through
  `PUT /api/nodes/:id/content`, which keeps the previous content as a version.

## 11. Email

`mail.ts` sends through the SMTP server configured in *Administration → Email* (stored in `settings` key `smtp`;
the password is never returned by the API) using `nodemailer`. Messages have a plain-text and a simple HTML part
and are sent in the background — failures are logged, never shown to the user who triggered them.
- **Password reset**: `POST /api/auth/forgot {login}` (username or email, case-insensitive) always answers 204 and
  is rate-limited per IP (5/h) and per account (3/h). It stores the SHA-256 of a random token in
  `password_resets` (60 min, one per user) and mails `<origin>/#/reset/<token>`. `POST /api/auth/reset
  {token, password}` consumes the token, sets the password, deletes all sessions and sends a notice.
  `GET /api/auth/options` tells the login page whether to offer it.
- **Notifications**: new user/group shares (recipients with an email and `notify_shares`, not the sharer) and
  password changes. Links use `PUBLIC_URL` or the origin of the request that caused the email.

## 12. Contacts import and export

`POST /api/addressbooks/:id/import` takes the raw file (20 MB, 20,000 contacts at most); `contacts-import.ts`
detects the format and encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16 with BOM, else Windows-1252).
- **vCard**: cards are split, unfolded and normalized to 3.0 (4.0 stays 4.0): vCard 2.1 quoted-printable values
  are decoded with their CHARSET, bare parameters become `TYPE=`, `item1.` groups are dropped, 2.1 text is escaped
  for 3.0, cards without FN get one from N/ORG/EMAIL/TEL, and every card gets a UID. ical.js validates the result.
- **CSV**: RFC 4180 with the delimiter guessed from the header (`,` `;` tab); columns are mapped by name (Google's
  `E-mail 1 - Value`, `::: `-separated multi-values, Outlook's `Home Street`… parts, plain `Name/Email/Phone`).
- **Duplicates**: a card whose UID exists replaces that contact; otherwise a contact with the same name and a shared
  email or phone (last 9 digits) is skipped. The response counts `imported`, `updated`, `duplicates`, `skipped`.
- `GET /api/addressbooks/:id/export` returns every card as one `text/vcard` file.

## 13. Connection check (Android)

*More → Connection check* (`ConnectionCheck.kt`) runs, from the phone, the requests other clients depend on:
`/status`, HTTPS, `GET /api/diagnostics` (what the server sees: `secure`, `origin`, `clientIp`, `trustProxy`, DAV
URLs), `PROPFIND` Depth 0 with Basic auth on `/dav/files/<user>/` and `/dav/`, `/.well-known/caldav|carddav`
without following redirects, one full upload chunk of a throwaway upload session that is then deleted (skipped on
metered networks), and the first line of `/api/events` within 8 s. Each result carries a proxy-specific fix.

## 14. Desktop sync

The desktop app (`desktop/src/main/sync.ts`) keeps one local folder in sync with the user's files. Each pass compares
three trees by relative path: the **local folder**, the **server** (`GET /api/nodes/:id`, with each folder's listing
cached and re-read only when the folder's etag changed, so an unchanged tree costs one request), and **base**, which
is both sides as they were after the last pass.

- A side has changed if it differs from base. A change on one side is copied to the other. Uploads use the
  resumable chunk API. Downloads go to a temp file next to the target and are renamed into place.
- Changes on both sides keep both: the local version becomes `name (conflicted copy <date>).ext` and is uploaded
  as a new file. Files of equal size with no shared history (a first sync into a filled folder) are compared byte
  for byte first.
- Renames and moves are recognised by inode (local) and node id (server) and repeated with a rename or a
  `PATCH /api/nodes/:id`, so a moved folder isn't transferred again.
- Deletions go to the server trash or the computer's trash. If at least 100 files and half the folder would be
  deleted at once, the app asks first; "keep" copies them back. A missing sync folder (for example an unmounted
  drive) stops syncing instead of deleting anything on the server.
- A pass is started by the folder watcher, by live events, every 5 minutes, and after waking from sleep.
- Concurrent uploads lock their folder's ancestor chain in id order on the server (`lockChain` in `files.ts`),
  because every write updates the sizes and etags of all ancestors.
